Consumer city to be built in Guangzhou,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043102.html,"A plan to build an international consumer center city in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, was released on Wednesday. It would be based on a consumption system with local characteristics.
The plan, the first of its kind in the country, was announced during the two-day Global Consumer Conference, which ended in the city's booming Nansha district on Wednesday. The conference brought together senior executives of about 400 retailers, manufacturers and service providers from 70 countries and regions.
Under the plan, five world-class landmark business circles such as Tianhe Road and Zhujiang New Town would be optimized, and two business circles featuring Guangdong characteristics (Lingnan) would be created.
Automobiles, fashion, beauty, leather goods and other industries would be promoted to the international market, and development of transportation, exhibitions, cultural tourism and consumption would be further integrated.
Additionally, flagship and chain stores and duty-free stores will be promoted to help optimize a diversified consumption system.
""We will offer targeted preferential policies for consumer brands, enterprise management and talent introduction, to help introduce more high-end international consumer brands,"" said Xie Xiaohui, the commerce authority director in Nansha district.
Guangzhou, together with Tianjin, Chongqing, Beijing and Shanghai, were approved by the State Council, China's Cabinet, in 2021 to build international consumption center cities.
Guangzhou's total consumption and foreign trade both exceeded 1 trillion yuan ($150 billion) in 2021. The city's total retail sales of consumer goods increased by 1.7 percent year-on-year in 2022, ranking among the top cities in the country and showing a strong development momentum."
Preferential policies meted out to beef up support for Macao firms,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043101.html,"Hengqin, South China's Guangdong Province, which underpins the financial rise of neighboring Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), has issued its first measures to support Macao-funded companies to better integrate into the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone.The measures, which aim to provide a good environment for Hong Kong and Macao-based companies while reducing their operating costs, come as the region badly needs a post-pandemic recovery. Experts said that the move will help companies become part of the booming development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) while injecting new momentum into Macao's economic rebound.A special fund has been established to back up the effort. Among all the measures, one highlight is the research and development (R&D) subsidy, able to cover 10 percent of the R&D expenses of a company in the previous year. The maximum is 5 million yuan ($721,000) per year for a single company that meets the criteria.The measures will also support private catering businesses in the cooperation zone with a one-time bonus of 300,000 yuan for a single company.Other subsidies such as rental fees and furnishing deductions for those who have business cooperation in the zone were also announced.According to the measure, the subsidies are mainly applicable to Macao-funded enterprises whose registration place, tax payments and management are in the cooperation zone. They must also have opened corporate deposit accounts in the banks in the cooperation zone.The subsidies come amid a rising need for Macao to drive its economic development, especially after the pandemic, which had a huge impact on the city, Liang Haiming, dean of the Hainan University Belt and Road Research Institute, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The adoption of the policies will help Macao companies to take the initiative to strengthen cooperation with neighboring Zhuhai while further integrating into the construction of the GBA, Liang said.More importantly, it is integrating into the new development pattern of the country's ""dual circulation"" strategy, which will enable Macao companies to embrace a broader market, the expert said.The announcement of the measures came less than two weeks after an opinion on supporting the construction of the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone was issued jointly by the People's Bank of China, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and other departments. The document will promote the interconnection between the cooperation zone and Macao's financial market and infrastructure.With more supportive measures in place, Macao-funded companies will be able to focus on business opportunities and markets in the Chinese mainland and better cooperate with other companies in the GBA in expanding overseas markets, Liang said."
HK’s first mainland-curriculum school to help deepen understanding of Chinese values and cultivate global vision,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043100.html,"Hong Kong's first school that offers a Chinese mainland curriculum will start operation as early as the 2026-27 school year, the Global Times learned. Yew Wah School of Hong Kong plans to offer 12 years of primary and secondary mainland curriculum education, ensuring students have a deep understanding of Chinese history, culture and values while cultivating their global vision and bilingualism in Chinese and English.Located in Tin Shui Wai, the school is about 20 minutes of drive from the neighboring city Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province, which provides more choices for families from the mainland to Hong Kong for work or investment, Troy Lui, chief education officer of Yew Chung Yew Wah Education, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview. The Education Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has allocated a greenfield site next to the Hong Kong Wetland Park for the Yew Chung Yew Wah Education Network to establish a non-profit-making private school offering mainland curriculum, and the school is expected to welcome its first batch of students in 2026 and will provide 900 school places. From the first to three years of the establishment of the school, it will offer primary and secondary curriculum, and from the four to six years, it will offer senior secondary curriculum and from seven to 10 years, the school is expected to offer curriculum covering 12 years of primary and secondary mainland curriculum education, Lui told the Global Times. ""Our goal is to become an excellent school for  racticing the mainland curriculum, and the school will also set up an internal review mechanism, taking reference from the mainland education authorities' annual inspection standards and international school certificate standards,"" he said. The chief education officer said that 900 school places in the initial stage will meet the current and future demand for mainland curriculum. The school, which mainly recruits mainland students from Hong Kong, will also serve Hong Kong local students who intend to study on the mainland.With the integrated development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and Hong Kong attraction to mainland talent, the demand from mainland families in Hong Kong for mainland curriculum will increase, according to local media reports. The school's mainland curriculum with elements of international curriculum implemented will help students, no matter which stage of study they are in, can seamlessly integrate with mainland courses, Lui said. ""On the other hand, it also allows students to have sufficient advantages in terms of bilingual, academic abilities and learning methods whether they choose mainland or oversea universities.""Hong Kong's education sector has seen a number of positive changes over the past few years since the implementation of the National Security Law for Hong Kong and the electoral reform, which helped bring back the social order and fix the loopholes in local governance. Courses in Yew Wah School of Hong Kong will be taught in Putonghua and English, not in Cantonese. The school has been promoting ""bilingual and multicultural education"" for many years. In Hong Kong, it is even biliterate and trilingual. Students in Yew Chung International School of Hong Kong - under the Yew Chung Yew Wah Education Network - can speak Cantonese, Putonghua and English. ""If mainland students come to Yew Wah School of Hong Kong in the future, they should inherit the existing tradition and be encouraged to develop the three spoken languages,"" Lui said. As the first school in Hong Kong to offer a mainland curriculum, Yew Wah School of Hong Kong has responded to the real needs of ""Hong Kong drifters."" For a long time, due to the different educational systems and examination content between Hong Kong and the mainland, ""Hong Kong drifters"" have faced practical problems such as their children's schooling while working in Hong Kong. Hong Kong drifters refer to people mostly hailing from the mainland who come to the city hoping to change their life for the better.Many mainland talents who have obtained permanent residence status in Hong Kong also express the willingness to let their children study in mainland courses, the Global Times learned."
Hengqin unveils incentives to lure Macau businesses to office buildings before rulebook takes effect,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043099.html,"Mainland Chinese authorities have dangled another package of financial stimulus to attract businesses from Macau to commercial buildings in neighbouring Hengqin, with eligible enterprises to be given subsidies across a wide range of fronts including renovation, rent, and research.
Authorities in the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin today issued what it called a “guidebook for Macau-funded enterprises” moving onto the island.
Prospective beneficiaries include companies incorporated in Macau and up and running for at least two years, with at least 25 per cent of their shares held by locals or legal persons from the SAR – by way of either direct or indirect ownership.
Businesses moving into commercial properties approved by Hegnqin authorities could be entitled to a rent allowance for as long as three years, to a maximum of 70 per cent of their evaluated rents – or RMB70 (US$10) per square metre a month.
An additional grant for refurbishment will also be available – up to 70 per cent of the renovation cost, or a maximum of RMB1000 per square.
Each enterprise could obtain at most RMB1 million under this measure.
The Hengqin administration also said that it would reward companies for producing revenue at a certain rate, with an enterprise given a one-off payment of RMB600,000, up to RMB1.2 million at most.
When it comes to scientific and technological research, as much as RMB5 million in grants could be provided to drive high-end manufacturing and advancements in technology.
According to today’s announcement, the MICE sector is also among the prospective beneficiaries of the fresh financial support, with each business looking to take part in conferences, events, and exhibitions to be given RMB150,000 in subsidies annually, as well as a 90-percent exemption from booth costs."
"GBA postdocs compete, exchange during Zhuhai competition",https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043097.html,"Thirty-seven teams from 22 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and 17 overseas countries and regions are competing in the ongoing finals of the 1st Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Postdoctoral Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition in Zhuhai, from Feb 27 to 28.
The competition attracted nearly 10,000 participants from 2,161 teams. Among them, 360 members come from Hong Kong and Macao, and 597 from overseas countries, officials announced at a Feb 26 press conference for the event at the Zhuhai International Convention & Exhibition Center in Shizimen.
The competition is expected to improve the innovation and entrepreneurship capabilities of young sci-tech postdoctoral talents, said Wei Jianwen of Guangdong Province's Department of Human Resources and Social Security. This will provide strong talent support for Guangdong to implement major development strategies, while also boosting Guangdong's socioeconomic development.
The submitted projects cover eight major industries, including new-generation information technology, semiconductors and integrated circuits, biomedicine and big health, high-end equipment manufacturing, new materials, new energy (including new-energy vehicles), energy conservation and environmental protection. All of which will cater to Guangdong's industrial cluster development.
Zhuang Wei, an academician of the Russian Academy of Engineering, expressed hopes that young postdocs in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao can learn from each other and share their outcomes during the event.
A talent exchange fair for doctorates and postdocs is held concurrently with the competition, gathering more than 200 higher education institutions, sci-tech research institutes, and famous enterprises, and creating platforms for high-caliber talents to share experiences and outcomes. Nearly 140 research institutes and more than 60 nationally famous investment and financing institutions also reach out to talents during this event.

How to propel growth of international I and T hub in HK?,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1042717.html,"The opening ceremony of the Hong Kong InnoX Academy was held on July 12, 2022. [Photo:/China News Service]
Promoting innovation and development has always been the top priority of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) government. The 14th Five-Year Plan clearly supports Hong Kong in building an international innovation and technology (I&T) hub.
On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, Xi Jinping — general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission — inspected the Hong Kong Science Park on June 30,2022.
Why is this ""the best time for Hong Kong to develop innovation and technology)?"" In an interview with ""W. E. Talk"" of China News Service, Teng Jinguang, president of Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and vice president of Greater Bay Area Association of Academicians (GBAAA), sorted out the advantages and disadvantages of Hong Kong's I&T development. He also made suggestions for building an international I&T center and integrating it into national science and technology development.
Excerpts from the interview:
CNS: On July 1, the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, President Xi delivered an important speech in Hong Kong and paid a special visit to the Hong Kong Science Park. What opportunities and advantages do you see for development?
Teng Jinguang: President Xi, on behalf of the central government, attaches great importance to it, with high expectations, which is an essential driving force for Hong Kong's I&T growth in the future.
Its main advantage lies in its rich reserve of talents in basic scientific research. Several universities in Hong Kong have made achievements in this field. Hong Kong is a place where Chinese and Western cultures blend, in line with international standards in mechanism. It is relatively easy to attract overseas talents because English is widely used, and it is convenient to communicate with other countries.
From the perspectives of planning, land release, talent policies and connectivity with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), Hong Kong's biggest I&T development opportunity in the future will lie in the northern metropolitan area.
CNS: The 14th Five-Year Plan clearly supports Hong Kong in building an international I&T hub. What efforts should Hong Kong make to develop innovation and technology?
Teng Jinguang: Despite all its advantages as an international financial center, Hong Kong has not developed a thriving I&T industry in the last few decades. The reason is that the chain of its industry is very long, from basic research to translational research and then to productization. Translational research and productization are very important, but Hong Kong has shortcomings in both. There are areas in which Hong Kong has a large enough market and capacity to develop its I&T industry, such as smart cities or services for the aging. However, other fields, such as microelectronics and artificial intelligence related to the industrial base, industrial chain, land supply and human resources, are restricted.
To develop the I&T industry in Hong Kong, we should first optimize land and talent policies, releasing more land. Only when land is available will there be land for industry. To attract talents to Hong Kong, we need to solve the housing problem, which also involves the land problem.
Hong Kong needs to enhance cooperation with the GBA and other cities on the mainland, as it has a small market in some sectors. Its scientific and technological research and development (R&D) achievements should be integrated with the market in the GBA and even in the whole country. In terms of manufacturing, Hong Kong also needs to integrate with the GBA's industrial chain and even the national market. For example, HAI Robotics Co., Ltd., a unicorn company cultivated by PolyU and a warehouse storage robot company, has few warehouses and a small market in Hong Kong, but it has developed well in Shenzhen.
The GBA and other cities on the mainland can make up for the deficiencies in Hong Kong's industrial chain and market. Without an industrial chain and market, it is difficult for R&D technology and application to succeed.
CNS: Many people in the I&T field describe Hong Kong's current I&T development prospects as a ""golden age."" Do you agree?
Teng Jinguang: Hong Kong's economic development has indeed reached the stage where the whole society has realized that on the basis of the original economic activities, including finance and real estate, it is necessary to promote some new economic activities and expand the I&T industry. At the same time, the country also needs to vigorously improve the level of science, technology and innovation capabilities. In this environment, we have formulated the GBA’s development strategy, positioning Hong Kong as an international I&T center, as was explicitly mentioned in the14th Five-Year Plan.
Hong Kong has the advantages of basic research talents, an international environment and advanced financial systems. In the last few years, the HKSAR government has made endless efforts and invested more than HK$150 billion ($19 billion) to promote I&T development. The previous HKSAR government also launched InnoHK to support local universities, world-renowned universities and research institutions in setting up joint laboratories in the Hong Kong Science Park for R&D.
So I think there has never been a better time for Hong Kong to develop its I&T industry.
CNS: As you mentioned, the HKSAR government has invested a lot of resources in I&T development. Do you think it is enough for now? What other aspects do you expect the SAR government to support in the future?
Teng Jinguang: At present, resource investment is good, but it will definitely continue in the future. Hong Kong has strong basic research capacity and abundant talents, but the funding for basic research is still insufficient. At the eight universities funded by the University Grants Committee in Hong Kong, there are only about 5,000 places for Ph.D. students directly funded by the HKSAR government. Of course, the universities will also use other funds to recruit doctoral candidates. We need more government-funded doctoral places to cultivate more creative talents.
For the projects (General Research Fund projects), funded by the Research Grants Council for local university scholars to engage in basic research, the funding of each project has not changed in 20 years. Many scholars call for an increase. Furthermore, the HKSAR government also needs to increase investment in application and translational research so that the research results can be better transformed into productivity.
CNS: What achievements has Hong Kong made in the last years?
Teng Jinguang: Over the last 20 years, there has been an obvious achievement: namely, developing several local universities into world-class universities. In 2020, Hong Kong conducted a research assessment, which concluded that about 70% of the research work done by eight universities in Hong Kong reached world-leading or international-excellence levels. What a big difference in more than 20 years!
Second, Hong Kong has made new progress in various aspects. For example, the Hong Kong Science Park and the Cyberport have been completed and put into use. Hong Kong is preparing to collaborate with Shenzhen to build a Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park at the Lok Ma Chau Loop in Hong Kong. The Innovation and Technology Fun under the Innovation and Technology Commission has also supported many projects so that some applied R&D centers have been established. These have laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's I&T growth.
CNS: Hong Kong has the unique advantage of its proximity to the mainland and strong international connections. Having worked overseas and taught in Hong Kong, you have an international academic background. Based on your own experience, can you talk about the similarities and differences between China and the West in the academic and industrial atmosphere? How can Hong Kong leverage its strengths to become an international I&T hub?
Teng Jinguang: In terms of the academic and industrial technology atmosphere between China and the West, it is difficult to specify. Generally speaking, the so-called West refers to some relatively developed countries, such as the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, whose culture is different from China's. Modern science and technology were first developed there. China has made great progress in the last few decades, but there is still a gap between China and the West in some areas, and we still need to develop and learn. We also have a lot of advantages, such as the state system, which allows us to concentrate our forces on major tasks. China's high-speed rail development is a good example.
Hong Kong should be better integrated into the national innovation system and contribute to the country with its own strengths. When the country is in need, Hong Kong can also make contributions. This is a good opportunity for development. For example, PolyU's participation in the Chang'e-5 lunar exploration mission, which contributed to the nation's first sampling from the surface of the moon and brought the samples back to Earth, demonstrated strengths.
CNS: Hong Kong has gradually begun to participate in more state-level scientific research projects. What advantages does Hong Kong's scientific research have in promoting national innovation and technology development?
Teng Jinguang: There are 16 State Key Laboratories and six Hong Kong Branches of Chinese National Engineering Research Centers, which are part of the national innovation and technology system. Local universities can also participate in or undertake research projects sponsored by the governments or enterprises of various mainland cities through the Shenzhen Research Institute.
I believe that in the future the SAR government will have closer scientific research cooperation with the central government, so that more competent Hong Kong scientists can participate in key R&D projects planned by the country. The funds can be supported by both sides. It is also an important way to integrate Hong Kong's research strength into the national science and technology development program.
For PolyU, we hope to encourage more teachers to visit the Greater Bay Area and other cities across the country after the pandemic. If our research capabilities are needed and recognized, we can discuss the establishment of translational Research Institutes of Technology, providing space and funding for research, with PolyU providing technology and professional guidance, so that the basic research results of PolyU can be applied everywhere. This will also increase our scientific research motivation and resources, making greater contributions to the national development of science and technology.

"Over 6,000 business visitors came to Macau in February",https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1041164.html,"More than 6,000 business travellers travelled to Macau from various provinces and cities in the Mainland to take part in conventions of large enterprises in the Region during February.
According to a press release from the Macau Trade and Investment Promotion Institute (IPIM), the institution “continues to work with the industry to bring quality MICE events to Macau, fostering a new business model for the MICE industry”.
To develop the high-end MICE market and increase the staying time of business travellers in Macau, IPIM not only provides support in terms of venue and service unit information, and coordinates with various departments to ensure the smooth running of events, but also provides targeted assistance to event organisers to integrate MICE activities and design unique and authentic cultural experience itineraries to drive more business cooperation and visitor spending.
Many convention organisers chose to arrange local tours of three days or more in Macau to let business travellers experience the charm of “MICE + Tourism” in Macau. Some organisers of five-day, four-night conventions in Macau have also commented that the city's prime location, convenient transportation and sophisticated convention and exhibition facilities have greatly reduced the time required for organising events, while Macau's rich historical and cultural heritage, the mixture of Chinese and Portuguese cultures, the concentration of world cuisine and abundant tourism resources make it ideal for diversified business tourism. Some of the event organisers have planned to hold conventions once again in Macau in April.
With the advancement of the Guangdong-Macau In-depth Co-operation Zone in Hengqin, including the “Measures to Support and Serve the Development of Guangdong-Macau In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin” announced by Macau Customs earlier and the “Guangdong-Macau In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin Development Promotion Ordinance”, which will be implemented on March 1, “multi-venue event” will be a good option to take advantages of Hengqin and Macau.
In the future, IPIM will continue to deepen its cooperation with the Co-operation Zone, better link up the venue resources and policy advantages of the two places, and work with Hengqin to strengthen the collaboration with higher education institutions, professional and commercial associations, integrated tourism and leisure enterprises to strive for influential and professional MICE events in their respective areas to be held as “multi-venue events”. The influence of branded MICE events, will facilitate the city’s attraction to investments and extend the MICE industrial change and nurture the city’s key industries."
Guangdong makes great strides in high-quality development,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1041161.html,"In a production workshop at GAC Aion, a NEV subsidiary of Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd, lines of industrial robots equipped with precise seven-axis robotic arms install the car tires and execute the welding of the steel-aluminum structure car body while two uniformed technicians monitor parameters on a digital screen.
With a new industrial park of more than 470,000 square meters and an investment of 45 billion yuan ($6.9 billion), the new plant in Guangzhou's Panyu district, which started construction in April 2017, has become not only a production base but a research and development center for the company.
""The total sales reached 271,000 units last year, up 126 percent year-on-year, the fastest growth rate in history. Since 2017, the average annual compound growth rate has exceeded 120 percent, and the industry ranking has risen from 16th to the current 3rd,"" said Xiao Yong, deputy general manager of GAC New Energy.
Production and sales of new-energy vehicles have soared in China since the beginning of 2022, thanks to the central government's persistent efforts to accelerate high-quality manufacturing and build up the nation's industrial competitiveness in the global marketplace.
For instance, the country exported 3.11 million vehicles in 2022, up 54.4 percent year-on-year, ranking China second only to Japan. Among them, a total of 679,000 new energy vehicles, which consist of electric cars and plug-in hybrids, were shipped overseas from China last year, up 120 percent year-on-year, said the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
A total of 301,000 vehicles were exported in January this year, jumping 30.1 percent from the same period last year. Meanwhile, NEV exports rose 48.2 percent year-on-year to 83,000 units, according to the CAAM.
""Benefiting from China's huge market size and the government's pro-growth measures, NEV production will continue to flourish and NEV-related new technology innovations will continue to be rolled out in the world's second-largest economy,"" said Xiao.
Regional cluster
Over 40 automobile parts and related enterprises are based in GAC Aion Zhilian new industrial park. As the chain leader in the park, GAC Aion could assemble a NEV in about a minute thanks to the efficient supply from partner firms.
To forge a more resilient firewall against risks to industrial and supply chains, South China's manufacturing giant Guangdong province introduced a chain-chief mechanism to leverage industrial synergy for win-win growth.
In the multi-player scheme, the local government, with a senior official as chain chief, encourages and supports an industrial giant to act as a chain leader to expand the ecosystem and coordinate efforts for shared development.
Guangdong has introduced a project to nurture chain leaders in 20 strategic industries, including automobiles and smart home appliances. Some 60 companies playing the role of chain leaders are expected to be in place in 2025.
By 2025, GAC Aion is expected to build all its core component factories nearby, and the output value of the enterprise will exceed 300 billion yuan ($46.5 billion), driving the output value of supporting facilities in and around Guangzhou province to about 2 trillion yuan ($309.6 billion).
What underpins China's steady industrial economic growth is the smooth and functioning industrial and supply chains, which even emerged stronger from downward pressure thanks to a raft of innovative attempts to keep the ball rolling.
The chain-chief scheme is not only about building a solid industrial chain. It also seeks to drive innovation, maintain stable supply and climb up the value chain.
With an investment of 35 billion yuan and an area of about 560,000 square meters, TCL Huaxing Guangzhou t9 project was put into production with an estimated monthly capacity of 88,000 glass substrates. This project is also the first high generation production line specializing in the production of high-end IT products and professional display LCD panels.
Kang Lianghui, director of Vacuum Technology Department of TCL Huaxing Guangzhou, said the t9 production line not only is a great improvement over the existing production line in terms of technical process, but also can make up for the shortcomings of TCL Huaxing in product structure and production line structure.
TCL Huaxing, which was founded in 2009, has established local leading advantages in TV and LTPS based on mobile applications in the past, but lacks competitive product lines in the higher-end commercial field. The production of t9 project will help TCL Huaxing to expand its business in medium-size IT panels and vehicle panels with higher added value, and improve its product matrix and business system in the full-size field.
TCL Huaxing also attaches great importance to cooperation with upstream and downstream partners. In September 2021, it released the ""Sunrise Plan"" with the purpose of strengthening the ecological construction of the entire display field.
""We give full play to the industrial agglomeration effect, form a semiconductor industry cluster and accelerate Guangzhou's goal of 'World Display Capital',"" said Kang.
All-around progress shines light on city's bright future
China's first commercial aerospace industrial base, namely ""CAS Space Industrial Base"", has started operation in the Nansha district of Guangzhou, with a targeted annual output capacity of 30 carrier rockets.
The base, which is mainly used for the production, testing and assembly of solid and liquid-fuel carrier rockets, covers an area of about 400,000 hectares in the Nansha district of Guangzhou city, south China's Guangdong province.
At present, the final assembly and testing processes of Lijian-1 Y-2 carrier rocket are being carried out at the aerospace base, with the launch scheduled for May 2023 from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China.
Meanwhile, the base is planned to open the space commercial travel market in 2025, with 7 people expected to be carried at a time.
In addition to the CAS Space Industrial Base, an increasing number of enterprises in Guangzhou have taken on leading roles globally in various sectors. Specialized in CCM and MEA technology for the cost-reduction of fuel cell products, Guangzhou-based SinoHyKey, which was founded in 2017, has developed double-sided patch coating technology that allows for precise ink application and accelerated manufacturing times. It provides high-efficiency, cost-friendly hydrogen solutions for all modes of transportation. The same can be said of electric vehicle maker Xpeng's flying car unit Xpeng Aeroht in low-altitude air mobility and Vector Builder in gene delivery."
