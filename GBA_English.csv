Zhuhai Avenue Expansion project proceeds well,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043872.html,"The last steel beam for the southern ramp of Niwanmen Bridge, a node of the Zhuhai Avenue expansion project, was installed on March 2, moving one step closer to the project's goal of opening by the year end.
Zhuhai Avenue is a key passage that connects Zhuhai's east and west wings, and as of late, it has seen significant traffic flow and congestion. The 4.55-kilometer (2.83-mile) expansion project will add ramps to expand the current artery, and the 666-m (728-yd) ramp bridges will be built at both north and south sides of Niwanmen Bridge. Upon operation, the bridge will have 12 dual lanes with a supporting slow traffic system.
Staff members from CRCC Harbour & Channel Engineering Bureau Group, the project's constructors, noted that the last five steel beams for the north ramp bridge are currently undergoing installation and are expected to be completed in the second half of 2023. Other works such as the Hezhou Tunnel, pedestrian overpasses, and roadbeds are also under construction.
The Hezhou Tunnel, an underground passage near the Hezhou North Bus Stop, has been drilled through and will start interior decoration soon, stated a Zhuhai Communication Group subsidiary, which is responsible for the passage's construction.
The tunnel, which is located near the entrance of the Jiangmen-Zhuhai Expressway, is now moving forward with main structure construction. It is expected to meet operational conditions in August, and is preparing for the following works for roads above it.
Once completed, Zhuhai Avenue will have more travel facilities such as non-motorized vehicle lanes, a pedestrian overpass, an underground passage, and a traffic light intersection.
Upon operation, Zhuhai Avenue will have dual eight lanes that will go under the Jiangmen-Zhuhai Expressway intersection. In addition, the six-lane ramp roads will connect to the Jiangmen-Zhuhai Expressway and Hezhou-Gaolan Port Expressway, which will increase transportation efficiency.
Its main line will have a maximum speed limit of 100 km per hour (62 mph), while the speed limit for the Hezhou Tunnel will be 80 km/h (50 mph).
Moreover, the city has been promoting the construction of a batch of fast pass renovation projects, such as the section of Zhuhai Avenue west of the Jinwan Interchange and Jiuzhou Avenue's Qianshan Interchange-Xingye Express section. These projects will help to establish a transportation network that allows motorists in Zhuhai to access expressways within 15 minutes.

Guangdong seeks qualitative breakthrough to drive manufacturing growth,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043644.html,"""Guangdong's OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) service took off 45 years ago, driving the province's foreign trade and overall development for years. Now that Guangdong's manufacturing industry has achieved leapfrog development, it needs a qualitative breakthrough to drive further growth,"" said Guo Wanda, Executive Vice President of China Development Institute (CDI).
The government of Guangdong vowed to improve the quality of its development on January 28, the first working day after the Chinese New Year, and emphasized that the manufacturing industry will play a fundamental role along its path to modernization.
To improve the quality of development, Guangdong highlights 20 strategic industrial clusters and eight industrial clusters with more than 1 trillion RMB in output, including new-generation electronic information, green petrochemicals, intelligent home appliances, advanced materials, modern light industry and textiles, software and information services, modern agriculture and food, and automobiles.
""The manufacturing industry, especially advanced manufacturing, is now the focus of competition between countries. As China's economic powerhouse, Guangdong emphasizes manufacturing industry for high-quality development and it is expected to boost market confidence and promote economic recovery,"" Guo told GDToday and Lianhe Zaobao in a joint interview on the high-quality development in Guangdong.
Manufacturing industry upgraded through increased R&D input
In 2018, Guangdong's basic research funding accounted for 4.23 percent of the total research and experimental development (R&D) expenditure. Guangdong has been increasing investment in basic research as the number grew to 5.87 percent in 2020 and 7.64 percent in 2022.
According to the Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province, the province's basic research spending will account for 10 percent of total R&D spending by 2025 and 13 percent by 2030.
Wang Jun, Former President of the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences, analyzed the increase in basic research investment, indicating that the province attaches great importance to original technological innovation.
Wang explained that Guangdong has been upgrading its industries since 2008. Compared with some developed countries, the province started with market demands and technological innovation, as its basic research was relatively weak. As the investment in basic research has increased, now Guangdong drives its development with both basic research and application research.
In addition, Wang believes that the electronic information industry, a pillar industry of Guangdong, will provide the technologies and industrial facilities needed for smart manufacturing and enable the province to seize opportunities in Industry 4.0.
In 2021, Guangdong's electronic information manufacturing industry above the designated size had revenue of 4.56 trillion RMB, accounting for 32.3 percent of China's total. Guangdong has an excellent industrial base in the fields of intelligent terminals, information and communication, and integrated circuit design, according to the Department of Industry and Information Technology of Guangdong Province.
""Guangdong manufacturers and their global counterparts will have more chances for communication and cooperation as China eased the travel restriction in January. Guangdong manufacturers are sensitive to market demand, and good at improving their technological innovation capability with global resources,"" said Wang.
SMEs suggested to pursue quality development with large enterprises
Large enterprises pursue high-quality development by enhancing their R&D capacity. BYD, one of the leading electric vehicle manufacturers, has about 49 thousand R&D staff members, and spent 10.87 billion RMB on R&D in the first three quarters of 2022. The company also has intelligent and automated production lines.
""Large-scale companies such as Midea, TCL, and Greek can take the lead in digitalization and automation as they can afford the costs in the trial period. But the cost and conversion rate of industrial upgrade frighten small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) away,"" said Wang.
He suggested that SMEs could work with big companies, which are often their clients, to achieve high-quality development.
In addition, the ""shared factories"" model was launched in Guangdong in recent years, providing SMEs with manufacturing space and a digitalized control system to improve efficiency.
""We found that there is a large number of SMEs in the traditional manufacturing industry in the Teochew region of Guangdong (which consists of Chaozhou, Shantou, Jieyang, and Shanwei). Most of these manufacturers are unfamiliar with digital technologies and incapable of using the software. Even though some manufacturers have applied industrial software in production, they don't have standard equipment to match the software,"" said Tan Boon Kee, Chairman of Jieyang Symbiosis Industry Co, Ltd.
Tan and his team started a ""smart factory"" model for a manufacturer in Jieyang in 2019, which can reduce labour costs and increase efficiency through automation production technology. In 2020, Tan established Jieyang Symbiosis Industry Co, Ltd and set up a shared-smart-factory for SMEs.
According to Tan, compared to the traditional production model, the shared-smart-factory help SMEs reduce production costs by 25 percent and increase production quality by 15 percent.

“European companies can benefit and have a lot to offer regarding economic diversification.”,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043646.html,"The head of the EU Office to the SARs, Thomas Gnocchi, is confident that European companies and professionals can play an important role in Macau’s push for economic diversification and the development of Hengqin. After a nearly three-year pandemic hiatus, the priority is to re-engage with local authorities and reignite cooperation projects.
Thomas Gnocchi became Head of the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macau in September 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the travel restrictions in place until early January, his first visit to the Macau SAR only took place in February 2023. In an interview with Macau Business and MBtv, Thomas Gnocchi shared his views on the need to re-engage with the local authorities to relaunch cooperation projects. To hold the EU-Macau Joint Committee Meeting, last held in 2019, as soon as possible ranks high on his agenda. The city’s push for economic diversification and the joint development of Hengqin bring opportunities for European companies and professionals, he says, while adding that he would like to address issues related to how to attract talent from Europe.
On the political front, the EU has raised concerns regarding some aspects of the recent implementation of the One Country Two Systems principle. Gnocchi adds that the amendment to the city’s national security law is being followed with particular attention.
How have you been dealing with Macau affairs over these two and a half years of COVID restrictions, being based in Hong Kong?
Thomas Gnocchi – Since the handover in 1999, we’ve been closely following the situation in Macau, and as you may know, we’ve had annual reports, which are a commitment we gave to the European Parliament to report on an annual basis on developments in Macau. For us, it’s very important to see what’s going on in Macau in the SAR and it’s important to actually be here in person. Over the past two and a half years, because of the COVID restrictions, our office couldn’t actually come here on the ground, but we’ve nonetheless had contact with a number of stakeholders, mainly by video conference, over the past few months and years.
Talking about the reopening of the two SARs after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. What are your expectations regarding this new phase?
T. G. –It was really high time this happened. I think the effect was not only on business but all walks of life in terms of the restrictions, in particular the travel restrictions. I think it’s really high time that this happened, so this is very much welcome. And I know that European businesses are relieved that we are coming back to normality and that we were able to engage in that in the relations, people-to-people exchanges. What’s important is to cover some of the ground which has been lost over the past almost three years. I can’t underline enough how important this is. On our level, we will fully take advantage of this by my coming as much as possible to Macau to interact with as many stakeholders as possible.
Over this three-year period of pandemic restrictions, bilateral cooperation was nearly stalled, as cooperation projects and meetings did not move forward. What are your priorities now regarding EU-Macau relations?
T. G. –I think that there are several priorities. First of all, we want to re-engage with the Government. It’s been now three years that we haven’t met officially with the Government. I think it would be very good that we do this it as soon as posisble. We have a mechanism called the Joint Commission, which, on our side, we are ready to hold as soon as feasible. So that’s on the broad level of relations. More specifically, in terms of the economy, there is, for example, the diversification strategy which the Government is really promoting. We think European companies can benefit a lot from that and have a lot to offer. So that would be one important area. For us, the environment is very important, and within the diversification strategy and within the commitments of the Central Government but also the two SARs in terms of the fight against climate change, I think European companies can offer many solutions, many state-of-the-art solutions in terms of environmental topics. So this is another important area of cooperation. Another area regards academic exchanges. This is something we would like to promote as well. We have something called the Erasmus Plus Program, and this can be offered to students from Macau. So this is yet another example of an area where we can cooperate.
How to further open the door to have a stronger presence here in terms of European companies, investment, trade, and skilled professionals? What role can the EU Office play in this respect?
T. G. –I would like to highlight the very good position Europe is in relation to its business relations with Macau. Last year we became the first trading partner Macau with 30% of Macau’s overall trade. So this is really important. It amounts to roughly €1.1 billion in the commercial exchange. I also think investment exchanges are pretty good, with  €1.8 billion of investments from Macau into the European Union and €1.4 billion coming from Europe into Macau. So there’s a solid base to work on. But there are issues to address to further improve this. One of the issues to address is how to attract talent to Macau, in particular talent from Europe. With the pandemic, we’ve seen that there’s been an outflow of people, including Europeans from Macau. So the idea is how to put in place the conditions for professionals, for talent to come and establish themselves in Macau and further boost the position of European companies. This is something we can take up with the government.
Economic diversification is taking centre stage in Macau’s development plans. The Government singled out key areas such as big health, high-tech, MICE, and modern finance. How can the EU and Macau team up in this drive for diversification?
T. G. –I think in most of the areas you mentioned, there is a strong contribution that can be made by European companies. I mentioned the environment, but I think when it comes to tourism and services to hi-tech, the hospitality industry—all these areas that are part of the diversification strategy—there is a lot to offer from Europe and European companies. Our role is to work on the overall environment this takes place. And if there are issues that can promote the European presence, we can bring these to the attention of the authorities, and we will do that. I mentioned the issue of attracting talent and having the conditions for European professionals to come and work here.
The development of the Guangdong-Macau In-depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin is set to be a main feature of the region’s development in the coming years. What opportunities lie ahead for European businesses in this process?
T. G. –We are looking at the Hengqin project, and many of our companies are looking at that, as well as, I would say, in more general terms, what’s happening across the whole Greater Bay Area, involving also Hong Kong. Developments are very rapid, and I think what I said earlier also applies to Hengqin. There are potentially many areas where Europe can play a role. I think there are some challenges in terms of harmonising different legal, customs, and regulatory areas, and there needs to be perhaps more clarity and transparency in terms of the plans. This will make it easier for European companies to see what’s happening and also to take advantage of other opportunities. As things develop, I hope to visit myself both Hengqin and the wider Greater Bay Area. I’m sure many of our businesses are also looking forward to engaging on these projects.
The latest annual report of the European Union on the Macau SAR, concerning 2021, stood out as having a more critical view of some aspects of the implementation of One Country Two Systems principle compared to previous reports.[Note: The report states that “in 2021, the way in which the ‘one country, two systems’ principle was implemented undermined the political rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Macau.”] What is the EU’s view on Macau’s One Country, Two Systems model?
T. G. –We attach a lot of importance to the One Country Two Systems principle, and we are looking at developments in that light. We’ve seen some pressures in relation to One Country Two Systems of which have raised some concerns, so I will be continuing to monitor the situation, in particular, I would say, regarding some of the political issues.
Central and local authorities have issued statements strongly rejecting some remarks included in the latest EU annual report on the SAR and urging “the EU to stop immediately its intervention in Macau’s internal affairs, as they are part of China’s domestic affairs.” What is your view on this?
T. G. –We come to this topic from the perspective that we see in both SARs that there have been commitments taken in terms of guaranteeing certain rights and freedoms in both documents, both the SARs’ [Basic Laws]. When we see that these rights and freedoms are under pressure and not being respected, I think for us we voice these concerns for a number of different reasons, whether it’s for the principle we hold dear, which is that certain fundamental freedoms should be respected, or if it’s about the effect this has on our EU citizens both in Macau and in Hong Kong. So, we have a number of reasons for voicing these concerns. This is the perspective from which we come.
The EU has issued statements on Hong Kong’s national security law. As Macau is carrying out amendments to the city’s existing national security act, what’s the EU’s approach to this matter?
T. G. –We are following this very closely, and we know that some of these amendments are making the law more restrictive. We would not want to see legislation that restricts in any way the rights and freedoms, which are guaranteed by the Basic Law. So, this is for us very important, and that’s an area which we will monitor very closely and look at with particular attention.
Over a decade ago, the EU launched the European Union Business Information Programme, which was broadly well-received here. Are you planning to revisit that? How about the other flagship cooperation projects, such as those in the legal field and simultaneous interpretation?
T. G. –I think this could be something we will look into. I can’t say right here that this is something we will replicate, but it is certainly something to explore to see what is needed. And we have a number of instruments that we could use in terms of that sort of project. We’ve had in the past other specific initiatives with Macau that have been very successful. Just to quote the interpretation and program: We’ve had the legal cooperation program. And those are examples of quite specific areas of cooperation, which we may look at either continuing or doing something similar. There are many ideas, and I think over the past three years, we haven’t been able to engage as much as we would’ve liked. I think there’s a lot to catch up on.
What is the future direction for EU-Macau bilateral cooperation, and how to maximise the common ground and shared interests?
T. G. –I think there is potentially a lot of common ground. As I said before, there’s a very good base to start on in terms of our economic relations. But also, in other areas, when you see culturally what Macau represents for historical reasons, I think it’s a very good point for furthering relations between the European Union and Macau. And as Macau tries to diversify from the gaming industry into many different areas, I think there are huge opportunities for Europe in the broader sense. I think the role of the European Union is to engage in a dialogue with the authorities that tries to promote this cooperation."

Consumer city to be built in Guangzhou,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043102.html,"A plan to build an international consumer center city in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, was released on Wednesday. It would be based on a consumption system with local characteristics.
The plan, the first of its kind in the country, was announced during the two-day Global Consumer Conference, which ended in the city's booming Nansha district on Wednesday. The conference brought together senior executives of about 400 retailers, manufacturers and service providers from 70 countries and regions.
Under the plan, five world-class landmark business circles such as Tianhe Road and Zhujiang New Town would be optimized, and two business circles featuring Guangdong characteristics (Lingnan) would be created.
Automobiles, fashion, beauty, leather goods and other industries would be promoted to the international market, and development of transportation, exhibitions, cultural tourism and consumption would be further integrated.
Additionally, flagship and chain stores and duty-free stores will be promoted to help optimize a diversified consumption system.
""We will offer targeted preferential policies for consumer brands, enterprise management and talent introduction, to help introduce more high-end international consumer brands,"" said Xie Xiaohui, the commerce authority director in Nansha district.
Guangzhou, together with Tianjin, Chongqing, Beijing and Shanghai, were approved by the State Council, China's Cabinet, in 2021 to build international consumption center cities.
Guangzhou's total consumption and foreign trade both exceeded 1 trillion yuan ($150 billion) in 2021. The city's total retail sales of consumer goods increased by 1.7 percent year-on-year in 2022, ranking among the top cities in the country and showing a strong development momentum."
Preferential policies meted out to beef up support for Macao firms,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043101.html,"Hengqin, South China's Guangdong Province, which underpins the financial rise of neighboring Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), has issued its first measures to support Macao-funded companies to better integrate into the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone.The measures, which aim to provide a good environment for Hong Kong and Macao-based companies while reducing their operating costs, come as the region badly needs a post-pandemic recovery. Experts said that the move will help companies become part of the booming development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) while injecting new momentum into Macao's economic rebound.A special fund has been established to back up the effort. Among all the measures, one highlight is the research and development (R&D) subsidy, able to cover 10 percent of the R&D expenses of a company in the previous year. The maximum is 5 million yuan ($721,000) per year for a single company that meets the criteria.The measures will also support private catering businesses in the cooperation zone with a one-time bonus of 300,000 yuan for a single company.Other subsidies such as rental fees and furnishing deductions for those who have business cooperation in the zone were also announced.According to the measure, the subsidies are mainly applicable to Macao-funded enterprises whose registration place, tax payments and management are in the cooperation zone. They must also have opened corporate deposit accounts in the banks in the cooperation zone.The subsidies come amid a rising need for Macao to drive its economic development, especially after the pandemic, which had a huge impact on the city, Liang Haiming, dean of the Hainan University Belt and Road Research Institute, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The adoption of the policies will help Macao companies to take the initiative to strengthen cooperation with neighboring Zhuhai while further integrating into the construction of the GBA, Liang said.More importantly, it is integrating into the new development pattern of the country's ""dual circulation"" strategy, which will enable Macao companies to embrace a broader market, the expert said.The announcement of the measures came less than two weeks after an opinion on supporting the construction of the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone was issued jointly by the People's Bank of China, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and other departments. The document will promote the interconnection between the cooperation zone and Macao's financial market and infrastructure.With more supportive measures in place, Macao-funded companies will be able to focus on business opportunities and markets in the Chinese mainland and better cooperate with other companies in the GBA in expanding overseas markets, Liang said."
HK’s first mainland-curriculum school to help deepen understanding of Chinese values and cultivate global vision,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043100.html,"Hong Kong's first school that offers a Chinese mainland curriculum will start operation as early as the 2026-27 school year, the Global Times learned. Yew Wah School of Hong Kong plans to offer 12 years of primary and secondary mainland curriculum education, ensuring students have a deep understanding of Chinese history, culture and values while cultivating their global vision and bilingualism in Chinese and English.Located in Tin Shui Wai, the school is about 20 minutes of drive from the neighboring city Shenzhen, South China's Guangdong Province, which provides more choices for families from the mainland to Hong Kong for work or investment, Troy Lui, chief education officer of Yew Chung Yew Wah Education, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview. The Education Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) has allocated a greenfield site next to the Hong Kong Wetland Park for the Yew Chung Yew Wah Education Network to establish a non-profit-making private school offering mainland curriculum, and the school is expected to welcome its first batch of students in 2026 and will provide 900 school places. From the first to three years of the establishment of the school, it will offer primary and secondary curriculum, and from the four to six years, it will offer senior secondary curriculum and from seven to 10 years, the school is expected to offer curriculum covering 12 years of primary and secondary mainland curriculum education, Lui told the Global Times. ""Our goal is to become an excellent school for  racticing the mainland curriculum, and the school will also set up an internal review mechanism, taking reference from the mainland education authorities' annual inspection standards and international school certificate standards,"" he said. The chief education officer said that 900 school places in the initial stage will meet the current and future demand for mainland curriculum. The school, which mainly recruits mainland students from Hong Kong, will also serve Hong Kong local students who intend to study on the mainland.With the integrated development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and Hong Kong attraction to mainland talent, the demand from mainland families in Hong Kong for mainland curriculum will increase, according to local media reports. The school's mainland curriculum with elements of international curriculum implemented will help students, no matter which stage of study they are in, can seamlessly integrate with mainland courses, Lui said. ""On the other hand, it also allows students to have sufficient advantages in terms of bilingual, academic abilities and learning methods whether they choose mainland or oversea universities.""Hong Kong's education sector has seen a number of positive changes over the past few years since the implementation of the National Security Law for Hong Kong and the electoral reform, which helped bring back the social order and fix the loopholes in local governance. Courses in Yew Wah School of Hong Kong will be taught in Putonghua and English, not in Cantonese. The school has been promoting ""bilingual and multicultural education"" for many years. In Hong Kong, it is even biliterate and trilingual. Students in Yew Chung International School of Hong Kong - under the Yew Chung Yew Wah Education Network - can speak Cantonese, Putonghua and English. ""If mainland students come to Yew Wah School of Hong Kong in the future, they should inherit the existing tradition and be encouraged to develop the three spoken languages,"" Lui said. As the first school in Hong Kong to offer a mainland curriculum, Yew Wah School of Hong Kong has responded to the real needs of ""Hong Kong drifters."" For a long time, due to the different educational systems and examination content between Hong Kong and the mainland, ""Hong Kong drifters"" have faced practical problems such as their children's schooling while working in Hong Kong. Hong Kong drifters refer to people mostly hailing from the mainland who come to the city hoping to change their life for the better.Many mainland talents who have obtained permanent residence status in Hong Kong also express the willingness to let their children study in mainland courses, the Global Times learned."
Hengqin unveils incentives to lure Macau businesses to office buildings before rulebook takes effect,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043099.html,"Mainland Chinese authorities have dangled another package of financial stimulus to attract businesses from Macau to commercial buildings in neighbouring Hengqin, with eligible enterprises to be given subsidies across a wide range of fronts including renovation, rent, and research.
Authorities in the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin today issued what it called a “guidebook for Macau-funded enterprises” moving onto the island.
Prospective beneficiaries include companies incorporated in Macau and up and running for at least two years, with at least 25 per cent of their shares held by locals or legal persons from the SAR – by way of either direct or indirect ownership.
Businesses moving into commercial properties approved by Hegnqin authorities could be entitled to a rent allowance for as long as three years, to a maximum of 70 per cent of their evaluated rents – or RMB70 (US$10) per square metre a month.
An additional grant for refurbishment will also be available – up to 70 per cent of the renovation cost, or a maximum of RMB1000 per square.
Each enterprise could obtain at most RMB1 million under this measure.
The Hengqin administration also said that it would reward companies for producing revenue at a certain rate, with an enterprise given a one-off payment of RMB600,000, up to RMB1.2 million at most.
When it comes to scientific and technological research, as much as RMB5 million in grants could be provided to drive high-end manufacturing and advancements in technology.
According to today’s announcement, the MICE sector is also among the prospective beneficiaries of the fresh financial support, with each business looking to take part in conferences, events, and exhibitions to be given RMB150,000 in subsidies annually, as well as a 90-percent exemption from booth costs."
"GBA postdocs compete, exchange during Zhuhai competition",https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1043097.html,"Thirty-seven teams from 22 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and 17 overseas countries and regions are competing in the ongoing finals of the 1st Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Postdoctoral Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition in Zhuhai, from Feb 27 to 28.
The competition attracted nearly 10,000 participants from 2,161 teams. Among them, 360 members come from Hong Kong and Macao, and 597 from overseas countries, officials announced at a Feb 26 press conference for the event at the Zhuhai International Convention & Exhibition Center in Shizimen.
The competition is expected to improve the innovation and entrepreneurship capabilities of young sci-tech postdoctoral talents, said Wei Jianwen of Guangdong Province's Department of Human Resources and Social Security. This will provide strong talent support for Guangdong to implement major development strategies, while also boosting Guangdong's socioeconomic development.
The submitted projects cover eight major industries, including new-generation information technology, semiconductors and integrated circuits, biomedicine and big health, high-end equipment manufacturing, new materials, new energy (including new-energy vehicles), energy conservation and environmental protection. All of which will cater to Guangdong's industrial cluster development.
Zhuang Wei, an academician of the Russian Academy of Engineering, expressed hopes that young postdocs in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao can learn from each other and share their outcomes during the event.
A talent exchange fair for doctorates and postdocs is held concurrently with the competition, gathering more than 200 higher education institutions, sci-tech research institutes, and famous enterprises, and creating platforms for high-caliber talents to share experiences and outcomes. Nearly 140 research institutes and more than 60 nationally famous investment and financing institutions also reach out to talents during this event.

How to propel growth of international I and T hub in HK?,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1042717.html,"The opening ceremony of the Hong Kong InnoX Academy was held on July 12, 2022. [Photo:/China News Service]
Promoting innovation and development has always been the top priority of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) government. The 14th Five-Year Plan clearly supports Hong Kong in building an international innovation and technology (I&T) hub.
On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, Xi Jinping — general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission — inspected the Hong Kong Science Park on June 30,2022.
Why is this ""the best time for Hong Kong to develop innovation and technology)?"" In an interview with ""W. E. Talk"" of China News Service, Teng Jinguang, president of Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and vice president of Greater Bay Area Association of Academicians (GBAAA), sorted out the advantages and disadvantages of Hong Kong's I&T development. He also made suggestions for building an international I&T center and integrating it into national science and technology development.
Excerpts from the interview:
CNS: On July 1, the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, President Xi delivered an important speech in Hong Kong and paid a special visit to the Hong Kong Science Park. What opportunities and advantages do you see for development?
Teng Jinguang: President Xi, on behalf of the central government, attaches great importance to it, with high expectations, which is an essential driving force for Hong Kong's I&T growth in the future.
Its main advantage lies in its rich reserve of talents in basic scientific research. Several universities in Hong Kong have made achievements in this field. Hong Kong is a place where Chinese and Western cultures blend, in line with international standards in mechanism. It is relatively easy to attract overseas talents because English is widely used, and it is convenient to communicate with other countries.
From the perspectives of planning, land release, talent policies and connectivity with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), Hong Kong's biggest I&T development opportunity in the future will lie in the northern metropolitan area.
CNS: The 14th Five-Year Plan clearly supports Hong Kong in building an international I&T hub. What efforts should Hong Kong make to develop innovation and technology?
Teng Jinguang: Despite all its advantages as an international financial center, Hong Kong has not developed a thriving I&T industry in the last few decades. The reason is that the chain of its industry is very long, from basic research to translational research and then to productization. Translational research and productization are very important, but Hong Kong has shortcomings in both. There are areas in which Hong Kong has a large enough market and capacity to develop its I&T industry, such as smart cities or services for the aging. However, other fields, such as microelectronics and artificial intelligence related to the industrial base, industrial chain, land supply and human resources, are restricted.
To develop the I&T industry in Hong Kong, we should first optimize land and talent policies, releasing more land. Only when land is available will there be land for industry. To attract talents to Hong Kong, we need to solve the housing problem, which also involves the land problem.
Hong Kong needs to enhance cooperation with the GBA and other cities on the mainland, as it has a small market in some sectors. Its scientific and technological research and development (R&D) achievements should be integrated with the market in the GBA and even in the whole country. In terms of manufacturing, Hong Kong also needs to integrate with the GBA's industrial chain and even the national market. For example, HAI Robotics Co., Ltd., a unicorn company cultivated by PolyU and a warehouse storage robot company, has few warehouses and a small market in Hong Kong, but it has developed well in Shenzhen.
The GBA and other cities on the mainland can make up for the deficiencies in Hong Kong's industrial chain and market. Without an industrial chain and market, it is difficult for R&D technology and application to succeed.
CNS: Many people in the I&T field describe Hong Kong's current I&T development prospects as a ""golden age."" Do you agree?
Teng Jinguang: Hong Kong's economic development has indeed reached the stage where the whole society has realized that on the basis of the original economic activities, including finance and real estate, it is necessary to promote some new economic activities and expand the I&T industry. At the same time, the country also needs to vigorously improve the level of science, technology and innovation capabilities. In this environment, we have formulated the GBA’s development strategy, positioning Hong Kong as an international I&T center, as was explicitly mentioned in the14th Five-Year Plan.
Hong Kong has the advantages of basic research talents, an international environment and advanced financial systems. In the last few years, the HKSAR government has made endless efforts and invested more than HK$150 billion ($19 billion) to promote I&T development. The previous HKSAR government also launched InnoHK to support local universities, world-renowned universities and research institutions in setting up joint laboratories in the Hong Kong Science Park for R&D.
So I think there has never been a better time for Hong Kong to develop its I&T industry.
CNS: As you mentioned, the HKSAR government has invested a lot of resources in I&T development. Do you think it is enough for now? What other aspects do you expect the SAR government to support in the future?
Teng Jinguang: At present, resource investment is good, but it will definitely continue in the future. Hong Kong has strong basic research capacity and abundant talents, but the funding for basic research is still insufficient. At the eight universities funded by the University Grants Committee in Hong Kong, there are only about 5,000 places for Ph.D. students directly funded by the HKSAR government. Of course, the universities will also use other funds to recruit doctoral candidates. We need more government-funded doctoral places to cultivate more creative talents.
For the projects (General Research Fund projects), funded by the Research Grants Council for local university scholars to engage in basic research, the funding of each project has not changed in 20 years. Many scholars call for an increase. Furthermore, the HKSAR government also needs to increase investment in application and translational research so that the research results can be better transformed into productivity.
CNS: What achievements has Hong Kong made in the last years?
Teng Jinguang: Over the last 20 years, there has been an obvious achievement: namely, developing several local universities into world-class universities. In 2020, Hong Kong conducted a research assessment, which concluded that about 70% of the research work done by eight universities in Hong Kong reached world-leading or international-excellence levels. What a big difference in more than 20 years!
Second, Hong Kong has made new progress in various aspects. For example, the Hong Kong Science Park and the Cyberport have been completed and put into use. Hong Kong is preparing to collaborate with Shenzhen to build a Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park at the Lok Ma Chau Loop in Hong Kong. The Innovation and Technology Fun under the Innovation and Technology Commission has also supported many projects so that some applied R&D centers have been established. These have laid a solid foundation for Hong Kong's I&T growth.
CNS: Hong Kong has the unique advantage of its proximity to the mainland and strong international connections. Having worked overseas and taught in Hong Kong, you have an international academic background. Based on your own experience, can you talk about the similarities and differences between China and the West in the academic and industrial atmosphere? How can Hong Kong leverage its strengths to become an international I&T hub?
Teng Jinguang: In terms of the academic and industrial technology atmosphere between China and the West, it is difficult to specify. Generally speaking, the so-called West refers to some relatively developed countries, such as the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, whose culture is different from China's. Modern science and technology were first developed there. China has made great progress in the last few decades, but there is still a gap between China and the West in some areas, and we still need to develop and learn. We also have a lot of advantages, such as the state system, which allows us to concentrate our forces on major tasks. China's high-speed rail development is a good example.
Hong Kong should be better integrated into the national innovation system and contribute to the country with its own strengths. When the country is in need, Hong Kong can also make contributions. This is a good opportunity for development. For example, PolyU's participation in the Chang'e-5 lunar exploration mission, which contributed to the nation's first sampling from the surface of the moon and brought the samples back to Earth, demonstrated strengths.
CNS: Hong Kong has gradually begun to participate in more state-level scientific research projects. What advantages does Hong Kong's scientific research have in promoting national innovation and technology development?
Teng Jinguang: There are 16 State Key Laboratories and six Hong Kong Branches of Chinese National Engineering Research Centers, which are part of the national innovation and technology system. Local universities can also participate in or undertake research projects sponsored by the governments or enterprises of various mainland cities through the Shenzhen Research Institute.
I believe that in the future the SAR government will have closer scientific research cooperation with the central government, so that more competent Hong Kong scientists can participate in key R&D projects planned by the country. The funds can be supported by both sides. It is also an important way to integrate Hong Kong's research strength into the national science and technology development program.
For PolyU, we hope to encourage more teachers to visit the Greater Bay Area and other cities across the country after the pandemic. If our research capabilities are needed and recognized, we can discuss the establishment of translational Research Institutes of Technology, providing space and funding for research, with PolyU providing technology and professional guidance, so that the basic research results of PolyU can be applied everywhere. This will also increase our scientific research motivation and resources, making greater contributions to the national development of science and technology.
CNS: The GBAAA was founded last year. As GBAAA vice chairman and one of its co-sponsors, what role do you think it will play in the Hong Kong's I&T development?
Teng Jinguang: Most GBAAA members are academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) working in the Greater Bay Area. CAS and CAE are both consulting groups that often make suggestions for national science and technology development policies. The academicians will also put forward policy suggestions to the HKSAR government and the central government on Hong Kong's I&T development and how to integrate it into the national technology development pattern. It will help Hong Kong better integrate into, and contribute to, national scientific and technological development."

"HKSAR, Macao SAR chief executives exchange views on cooperation, GBA development",https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1042573.html,"Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) John Lee and Chief Executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) Ho Iat Seng met Saturday in Hong Kong, exchanging views on promoting cooperation between the two SARs and high-quality development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA).
Lee said that since the implementation of full resumption of normal travel between Hong Kong and Macao on Feb 6, travel between the two places has resumed vigorously, demonstrating close ties and connection between Hong Kong and Macao.
He added that being SARs of China, both Hong Kong and Macao uphold the principle of ""one country"" while leveraging the advantages of ""two systems"". With the unique advantages under ""one country, two systems"", Hong Kong and Macao are integrated into the mainland while having strong international connectivity, serving as a bridge linking the mainland and the rest of the world.
Hong Kong and Macao are both cities in the GBA, jointly promoting regional development, participating in, contributing to and benefiting from the prosperous development of the country, Lee said.
He said that Hong Kong and Macao had all along been maintaining close cooperation in various areas, including commerce, cross-boundary infrastructure and cultural tourism under the spirit of complementarity, with a view to jointly promoting the development of the GBA.
Ho said that Hong Kong and Macao have a close relationship, and Hong Kong has given Macao strong support in many aspects. The two SARs will strengthen cooperation and coordinated development in science and technology innovation, finance, traditional Chinese medicine, tourism, culture, sports and other fields, and promote win-win cooperation in industrial development.
Ho said that Hong Kong and Macao could further strengthen cooperation and jointly organize major events in the process of participating in the high-quality development of the GBA and integrating into the country's overall development, so as to inject new impetus into the development of the GBA, create a better life for residents and jointly write a new chapter in the great cause of ""one country, two systems"".
Ho led a delegation from the Macao SAR government to Hong Kong Saturday. The delegation visited the Hong Kong Science Park and the Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine Drug Development, and learned more about the progress and opportunities for cooperation."
Macao CE: All-out effort to implement ‘Opinions’ document for Cooperation Zone in Hengqin,https://www.cnbayarea.org.cn/english/News/content/post_1042572.html,"The Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR) Government will devote its utmost effort to implement the guidance outlined in the Opinions on Financial Support for the Development of the Guangdong-Macao Intensive Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and in other related policies introduced to accelerate the development of the Cooperation Zone.
The Chief Executive, Mr Ho Iat Seng, spoke to reporters today in Hengqin, after attending a ceremony marking the “Policy Release on Financial Support for the Development of the Guangdong-Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone in Hengqin and the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone”.
Mr Ho stated that the Central Government and other relevant departments had, since the establishment of the Cooperation Zone on 17 September 2021, given strong support to the latter’s development, injecting new impetus into the project and contributing to its advancement.
The Chief Executive said he believed that the Cooperation Zone had bright development prospects, underpinned by the joint effort of the MSAR Government and the Guangdong Government in the framework of the Master Plan of the Development of the Guangdong-Macao Intensive Cooperation Zone in Hengqin, in conjunction with a number of favourable measures that were being introduced: from preferential customs and immigration policies, to the promulgation of the Regulation for Promoting Development of the Guangdong-Macao Intensive Cooperation Zone in Hengqin, as well as the publishing of the latest Opinions document.
Mr Ho discussed some of the measures featured in the Opinions document, including Macao’s role as a financial service platform for commercial and trade cooperation between China and Portuguese-speaking countries. He said Macao was playing that role effectively: Mr Ho noted that the headquarters and the supporting office to the permanent secretariat of the Forum for Economic and Trade Co-operation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries were both based in Macao.
In addition, he added, the MSAR Government had always played an important role in helping to organise the Ministerial Conference of the Forum for Economic and Trade Co-operation between China and Portuguese-speaking Countries. There were plans for Macao to host this year another edition of the Ministerial Conference, and MSAR Government was stepping up effort to support the event, said Mr Ho.
In a separate occasion today, speaking on the sidelines of a reception to mark the International Women's Day, Mr Ho stated that the mutual recognition of driving licences between the mainland and Macao did not mean that drivers from the mainland had the right to work in Macao. The new measure would not affect driver positions reserved for Macao ID holders only, Mr Ho stressed.
The Chief Executive also talked about the planning of a forthcoming visit to Portugal, Luxembourg and Belgium, which aimed to strengthen external exchange and bolster synergy within industries.
He said he was confident that city-wide gross gaming revenue for 2023 would meet the Government’s target of 130 billion patacas."
